# AirBnB Clone - The Console

---

## Description

This project is the first step towards building a full web application of the AirBnB clone. In this first step we are building a console, a custom command interpreter that will be used in subsequent AirBnB projects to manage objects of our classes.

This console will allow us to do the following:

* Create a `new object`
* Retrieve an object from a `file, a database etc…`
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Usage

* The console can be run in both interactive and non-interactive mode.
* It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

### Interactive Mode

```cmd
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

```cmd
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```

## Commands

Command | Description
--- | ---
`quit` | Exits the program
`EOF` | Exits the program
`create <class>` | Creates an instance of a class
`show <class> <id>` | Prints the string representation of an instance of a class based on class name and id
`destroy <class> <id>` | Deletes instance of a class based on class name and id
`all` | Prints all string representations of all instances
`all <class>` | Prints all string representations of all instances based on class name
`update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"` | Updates an attribute of an instance based on class name and id
`<class>.all()` | Retrieves all instances of a class
`<class>.count()` | Retrieves the number of instances of a class
`<class>.show(<id>)` | Retrieves an instance based on its id
`<class>.destroy(<id>)` | Destroys an instance based on its id

# PART 2 OF AIRBNB CLONE - WEBSTATIC 
Web static, what?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.

Before starting, please fork or clone the repository AirBnB_clone from your partner if you were not the owner of the previous project.
